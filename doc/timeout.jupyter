    # Cell Execution Timeout
    
    By default, `nbconvert` (which is used to execute the notebooks during the Sphinx build process) will give a cell 30 seconds to execute before it times out.
    
    If you would like to change the amount of time given for a cell, you can change the timeout length for all notebooks by setting the following option in [conf.py](conf.py):
    
    ```python
    nbsphinx_timeout = 60
    ```
    
    Or change the timeout length on a per-notebook basis by adding this to the notebook's JSON metadata:
    
    ```
    "nbsphinx": {
      "timeout": 60
    },
    ```
    
    The timeout is given in seconds, use `-1` to disable the timeout.
    
    Alternatively, you can manually execute the notebook in question and save the results, see [the pre-executed example notebook](pre-executed.ipynb).
