Jupyter Notebook Tools for Sphinx
=================================

``nbsphinx`` is a Sphinx_ extension that provides a source parser for
``*.ipynb`` files.
Custom Sphinx directives are used to show `Jupyter Notebook`_ code cells (and of
course their results) in both HTML and LaTeX output.
Un-evaluated notebooks -- i.e. notebooks without stored output cells -- will be
automatically executed during the Sphinx build process.
